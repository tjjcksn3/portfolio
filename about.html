  <h2> Get to know me!</h2>
  <p class="p3">I'm a UX Designer from Memphis, TN and a soon to be graduate from The University of Memphis, where I studied Psychology with a Cognitive Science concentration. 
    I am currently seeking an internship or full time opportunity in UX Design. My favorite color is pink, and I love all things style/fashion. I consider myself to a music enthusiastic. 
    I love listening to jazz, video game music, R&B, Hip-Hop, Pop, K-Pop, and so much more! In my free time, I like to study different languages and make things look pretty. 
    If you're interested in working together, contact me!</p>
